# Objective: Beat Grandma Janey at Words with Friends

Her reign of terror has gone on long enough. It's time I put a stop to it.

## Approach

Given a board and a set of in-hand tiles, calculate the word and position of the word that reaps the most points.

## Elevator pitch

- I/O: Python3 CLI
- Board data structure: list of comma separated rows
- Hard-code board size and special tiles
- Dictionary: {ENABLE word list} + {WWF2-added-words} - {WWF2-removed-words}

## Functionality

**Python3 CLI**

**Algorithmic Functions and Flow**

## Edge cases:

- Opening move (empty board) special case?s
- Blank tile
